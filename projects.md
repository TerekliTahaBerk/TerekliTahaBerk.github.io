# Data Science Portfolio
This repository showcases my data science portfolio, featuring projects completed for academic purposes, self-learning, and personal hobbies. It highlights a variety of topics and techniques, demonstrating my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and problem-solving, while reflecting my passion for exploring diverse challenges in the field.

_Note: Data used in the projects is for demonstration purposes only._

## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1.	Install all necessary dependencies by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2.	Open the notebooks using your preferred environment, such as Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or an IDE like VS Code.
3.	Run the cells as needed to execute the code.

## Contents
- ### Machine Learning
    - [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Predicting%20Boston%20Housing%20Prices/Predicting_Boston_Housing_Prices.ipynb): This project is an analytical study that utilizes data science and machine learning methods to predict housing prices in Boston. Factors influencing housing prices were examined, followed by data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and the application of predictive models to derive results. This study aims to enhance the understanding of both data science techniques and the dynamics of the real estate market.

    _Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pygame_

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
    - #### Python 
        - [Titanic Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/TerekliTahaBerk/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/Titanic%20Dataset%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis/Titanic_Dataset_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.ipynb): This project involves a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the passengers onboard the RMS Titanic, focusing on their demographic, socioeconomic, and survival characteristics. Using Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis, combined with the powerful visualization capabilities of Seaborn, the study aims to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights about the passengers and factors influencing survival during the tragic maritime disaster.
